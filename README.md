**Traffic Sign Recognition System**
This repository contains an image processing project called the Traffic Sign Recognition System. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can accurately recognize and classify traffic signs using computer vision techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras, the system achieves high accuracy in recognizing various types of traffic signs.
**Project Overview**
The Traffic Sign Recognition System utilizes the following key components and techniques:
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The system employs a CNN to extract and learn meaningful visual features from traffic sign images, enabling accurate classification.
2. Dataset: The project uses a labeled dataset containing images of different traffic signs. The dataset includes various classes, such as speed limits, stop signs, yield        signs, and more. The training and testing sets are preprocessed and used to train and evaluate the CNN.
3. Python Libraries: Python libraries, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras, are used for image preprocessing, CNN model training, and performance evaluation.

**Project Details**
The Traffic Sign Recognition System focuses on utilizing the EfficientNetB3 neural network architecture. EfficientNetB3 is an efficient and powerful neural network that has been trained on millions of images by Google. The system leverages this pre-trained model to recognize 43 different traffic sign classes, including speed limits, turning right, and U-turn.
The dataset used in this project consists of 43 classes, with each class comprising 160 training images and 20 test images. Python concepts such as listdir, mkdir, directories, and dictionaries are employed in the implementation of the system.
**Getting Started**
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.
